name: AeroBridge AI Operating Environment — Final Pre-Opus Reconciliation
status: SIXTH PASS / FINAL PRE-OPUS PREPARATION — PROPOSED / NOT CANONICAL.
  This is the corrected Final Convergence Report, produced specifically to
  fix places where the prior pass drifted toward pretending to answer
  questions only Opus's inspection of the real project corpus can actually
  answer. Advisory only. No AeroBridge artifact, repository content, Skill,
  Plugin, Hook, integration, or project configuration was created,
  modified, installed, or configured while producing this document.
owns: The principal pre-Opus preparation artifact — corrected for overstated
  certainty, reclassified into what's actually established now versus what
  must genuinely wait for Opus, with one new adversarial sweep and one
  structural proposal (independent Opus staging) this pass adds.
relationship to prior passes: Every prior pass — including this document's
  own immediate predecessor, the Final Convergence Report — is treated as
  a review object, not as truth. This pass's own conclusions carry the
  same status: proposals for Karim's approval, not decisions.
source basis: Everything the first five passes were built on. No new
  external research was required for this pass — its work is internal:
  re-reading the prior chain adversarially, distinguishing what it can
  responsibly claim now from what it was quietly claiming to know that
  only Opus's corpus inspection can actually settle.
authority: Same as every prior pass — a technical agent's recommendation
  under delegation (Operating Constitution §4). It can recommend and flag
  risk; it cannot approve, and it explicitly does not substitute for the
  independent Opus review this whole chain has been preparing for.

# AeroBridge — AI Operating Environment: Final Pre-Opus Reconciliation

## Framing

This pass's job is narrower than every pass before it, and that narrowness is the point: not to add more analysis, but to make sure the analysis already done is *honest about its own limits*. The prior pass (the Final Convergence Report) is sound in most of what it established, but on re-reading it adversarially against this task's own specific warning — *"do not close questions that can only be answered properly after Opus inspects the actual project files"* — several places state a specific implementation choice with more confidence than the evidence available at this stage actually supports. Those are corrected below, not by weakening the underlying finding, but by separating *what the finding actually establishes* from *the specific fix this pass had been proposing on top of it*.

---

## Three Levels of Knowledge, Applied Throughout

Decision-relevant recommendations and claims are classified into these tiers where classification materially matters. Where a section is descriptive, procedural, or already governed by an established requirement, an explicit tier label is not required. Where a tier is used, the tiers are not collapsed into each other:

- **Established now** — supported by evidence about how the tools/platform actually work, independent of anything specific to AeroBridge's real repository or corpus.
- **Strong candidate** — well-reasoned, but genuinely needs validation against the real corpus or real implementation before being treated as settled.
- **Opus-dependent** — deliberately left open, because only inspection of the actual project files can responsibly close it.

---

## A. What Survived

Everything in the Final Convergence Report's own §A, plus all twelve of its observation-level corrections, survives as **Established now** or **Strong candidate** according to the classifications and reservations set out throughout this document. Most of the prior analysis survived, but several observations exposed genuine factual errors (Skills-sync mechanics, notably) as well as places where conclusions were stated with more finality than the available evidence supported — the two are kept distinct, not collapsed into one softer category. The core operating direction (chat-based Project work now; `CLAUDE.md` + hook + `opusplan`/advisor once Claude Code begins; Claude Design gated on Design Execution reopening; Cowork narrow-use-only) survives as the strongest current candidate, while its specific implementation mechanisms and other Opus-dependent details remain open to confirmation, modification, or replacement once Opus inspects the actual project corpus.

## B. What Changed

### B.1 — Independent Opus staging: corrected to a four-stage sequence, superseding this pass's own earlier draft

This section was drafted once already in this same pass, proposing a *blind-corpus-first* two-session structure (inspect the actual project with zero awareness this operating-environment chain exists, only afterward show it the chain). That draft is superseded below, not merely refined — the replacement sequence is materially different in what it treats as safe to read first, and the reason for the change is worth stating rather than silently swapping one version for another.

**The corrected sequence, in four stages:**

- **Stage 1 — read the preparation brief.** Opus reads this report first, as context and prior analysis. The report may calibrate *how* Opus should work — operating method, delegation, verification, escalation, context management, and related process considerations — but it must not be treated as evidence for substantive claims about AeroBridge's product direction, learning effectiveness, Amadeus behavior, implementation state, or other domain truth. Its purpose at this stage is methodological calibration, not content authority.
- **Stage 2 — design or improve the operating method.** Before touching the real corpus, Opus uses its own reasoning — informed by, but not bound by, this report's candidate operating model (below) — to decide how it will actually work for the rest of this engagement: when to reason directly versus delegate, how it will verify claims, when to escalate, how it will manage context. Opus may adopt, modify, simplify, or discard anything proposed here.
- **Stage 3 — inspect the actual project using that method.** Only now does Opus review the relevant current AeroBridge corpus — including the canonical files, Learning Foundation documents, applicable strategic/design inputs, governing operational documents, and, when relevant, the real repository — using whatever operating method it settled on in Stage 2. Opus decides which of these are task-relevant after seeing the actual project, rather than being required to read all of them indiscriminately. This is where genuine, independent, corpus-level findings are formed.
- **Stage 4 — reconcile.** Only after Stage 3's findings exist does Opus weigh them against this report's specific recommendations, retaining, correcting, replacing, or removing each on the evidence, never on this report's authority.

**Why this sequence is correct where the earlier draft in this same pass was not:** the contamination risk the earlier draft was guarding against — a reviewer's substantive conclusions being shaped by seeing someone else's conclusions first — applies to *content* judgments (is this Amadeus claim right, is this learning design sound), not to *operating-method* calibration (how carefully should I verify, when should I escalate). This report does contain substantive claims of its own — about tools, workflows, file classification, and candidate mechanisms — so the relevant distinction isn't that it's empty of content. The distinction is threefold, and worth stating precisely rather than as a single absolute claim: **the report's intended function at Stage 1 is to calibrate how Opus approaches the work, not to supply what it should conclude; its authority boundary is that it must not be treated as authoritative evidence for what Opus concludes about AeroBridge's actual product, learning system, Amadeus behavior, implementation state, or repository state; and the independence requirement is that Stage 3 must form its actual corpus-level findings from the current project evidence, rather than inheriting this report's substantive conclusions as established truth.** Reading a procedure-and-method brief before entering the actual review is closer to a reviewer reading their own verification checklist before starting than to being shown a colleague's conclusion before forming an independent one — a reasonable expectation given how Stage 1 is scoped, not a guarantee this document can prove in advance.

**If Opus itself judges a different sequencing stronger for preserving quality or independence once it's actually operating, it should use that sequencing instead and state why** — this document does not treat its own sequencing proposal as binding on the reviewer it's proposing it for.

### B.2 — Prompt Engineering and Prompt Optimization: mechanism deliberately left open

Established now: AeroBridge already has a dedicated Prompt Engineering & Governance authority, and prompt quality should remain governed by that source rather than duplicated across multiple mechanisms.

Additional requirement for Opus to evaluate: AeroBridge would benefit from considering a reusable prompt-optimization capability that can take a raw user intent or rough task description and transform it into a stronger, AeroBridge-compliant executable prompt by applying the current Prompt Engineering & Governance rules, rather than requiring repeated manual instructions to "read the prompt-engineering file first, understand its rules, and then rewrite the prompt." The intended outcome is to reduce repetitive prompt-construction overhead while preserving the authority, boundaries, verification discipline, and project-specific constraints already established by the governing Prompt Engineering documentation.

This is an **architectural intent, not an implementation decision**. Opus should determine whether such a capability is actually justified after inspecting the real project workflow and how prompt-construction work recurs in practice. If justified, Opus should determine the minimum effective mechanism — which may be a Skill, Plugin, Hook, `CLAUDE.md` rule/pointer, ordinary prompt pattern, or another mechanism entirely — and whether optimization should be user-invoked, automatically applied in defined contexts, or both.

The mechanism must **not become a second source of truth**. The Prompt Engineering & Governance file remains authoritative for prompt-construction rules; an optimization mechanism should reference and apply those rules rather than silently creating or maintaining a parallel copy of them. Opus should also determine where optimization is useful versus where it would add unnecessary context, latency, complexity, or token cost, and should preserve the user's original intent rather than optimizing prompts into a different task.

The evaluation should explicitly consider:

- whether the capability materially improves prompt quality, consistency, speed, or reliability on real AeroBridge work;
- whether the existing Prompt Engineering & Governance document plus ordinary prompting already solve the problem adequately;
- whether the proposed mechanism creates governance duplication, drift, unnecessary context consumption, or hidden behavior;
- what scope of prompts it should optimize, and when it should deliberately do nothing;
- how it should handle uncertainty, missing context, or prompts that require substantive project decisions before optimization is appropriate; and
- how its effectiveness would be validated against representative real AeroBridge tasks rather than assumed from the mechanism's existence.

**Classification: the underlying need and architectural intent are a Strong candidate for Opus evaluation; the mechanism, scope, trigger conditions, and implementation remain explicitly Opus-dependent.**

### B.3 — The canonical-file mirror: the requirement stays established, the structure moves to Opus-dependent

**What was over-specified:** a named path (`/docs/canonical/`), a "situational, not blanket" mirroring policy, and a specific header-based staleness convention — all stated as if decided.

**Corrected split:**
- **Established now:** the operating environment needs a reliable way for Claude Code to access this Project's canonical content — this Project's Knowledge store and a real repository's local filesystem are structurally separate locations with no confirmed live-fetch bridge between them, and Claude Code reads local files. This is a fact about how the tools work, not a guess.
- **Strong candidate, not locked:** given that separation, a repository-local mirror is a strong candidate approach (versus, say, a submodule, a fetched reference, or another arrangement Opus might prefer once it can see the real repository) — reasonable, but not the only conceivable solution.
- **Opus-dependent, explicitly:** the exact location, whether it covers the full corpus or is task-scoped, the staleness-representation mechanism, and whether mirror files should be structurally uneditable versus editable-with-review — **all of this should wait for Opus's own inspection of the actual repository**, which may reveal constraints (an existing docs convention, a chosen framework's own opinions about file layout) this chain has no way to know in advance.

### B.4 — `opusplan`: the version-specific finding stays version-specific, explicitly

The Final Convergence Report already corrected the Fourth Pass's overclaim (treating a GitHub issue as permanent architecture) into a verification habit. This pass adds one more precision: even that correction should be treated as time-bound and framed as **currently-issue-reported, not architecturally guaranteed to remain true or false in either direction** — including the possibility that Anthropic fixes it, that it recurs differently, or that an account using a 1M-context configuration never encounters it at all. **The durable, version-resilient recommendation, stated once and not overqualified further: verify which model actually produced a response on any long planning session, regardless of the specific mechanism that might cause a mismatch.** That habit doesn't need updating no matter how the underlying platform changes; the specific bug report does.

### B.5 — Fable and the budget: unchanged, confirmed correct to keep firm

Re-checked directly against this task's own instruction not to weaken a policy for an attractive feature: the REJECT verdict stands exactly as the Convergence Report stated it. Nothing here needed correction.

### B.6 — Hooks: the general vulnerability is established; the exact configuration is not

**Established now:** `Edit`/`Write`-only hook coverage is insufficient because `Bash` can write files through paths a narrower matcher never sees — this is a fact about Claude Code's own tool architecture, confirmed directly against official documentation, not something that depends on AeroBridge's specific repository.

**Opus-dependent:** the exact hook matcher configuration, the exact protected-path list, and whether filesystem-level permissions are the right second layer for the real repository's actual structure — all of this needs the real repository in front of it. What this document can responsibly assert now is the *principle* (defense-in-depth against accidental/imprecise edits, not a claim of airtight protection against a determined attempt to bypass it) — not the literal configuration.

### B.7 — Security plugins: recommendation preserved, certainty level corrected downward

`security-guidance` continuous by default, `Claude Security` tied to phase-completion or high-risk milestones — re-checked against this task's own capability × need × cost × permissions × context × timing framework: no capability overlap; no additional cost has been identified under the current verified setup; no additional permission concern has been identified at the tool level beyond the permissions already associated with Claude Code, subject to validation against the actual project setup; minimal context burden. The direction holds up well on the evidence available now, but stating it as a fully settled conclusion is itself more certainty than is warranted before Opus can see the real project. **Corrected classification: strong current candidate, subject to Opus/project validation** — the recommended direction (continuous by default, deeper review at meaningful milestones, no unnecessary overlap) is unchanged; only its status moves from "settled" to "strongly supported pending confirmation against the actual repository and Opus's own judgment."

### B.8 — Skills across surfaces: the distinctions the Convergence Report drew are confirmed as the correct set of distinctions

Skill portability, project-context portability, canonical-knowledge availability, and surface-specific configuration are genuinely four different things, and the prior pass's corrected table already kept them separate rather than collapsing them. Re-confirmed, not re-argued.

### B.9 — Cowork: narrow-use verdict confirmed, with one genuine new tension resolved (see the Additional Adversarial Sweep, below)

### B.10 — Memory continuity and historical retrieval: evaluate the need, not a predetermined implementation

The current memory resolution should be expanded to explicitly address a broader question: whether AeroBridge needs a deliberate mechanism for preserving and retrieving useful historical project context across sessions beyond the current Project Knowledge, canonical corpus, handoff protocol, and structured state/decision records.

The question is not whether to automatically retain a complete transcript-level memory of every session. That is only one possible approach and should not be treated as the default.

Opus should evaluate whether AeroBridge would materially benefit from a selective historical-memory layer that could preserve and retrieve high-value information from prior sessions, such as:

• decisions and their rationale;

• unresolved questions and their current status;

• important implementation discoveries;

• failed approaches and why they failed;

• recurring problems and their known solutions;

• significant debugging history;

• assumptions that were later invalidated;

• important handoff state that is useful across sessions but does not belong in canonical project truth;

• and other historical context whose retrieval could prevent repeated investigation or repeated mistakes.

This evaluation should also consider whether the project would benefit from one or more of the following mechanisms, without presuming that any of them is necessary:

• structured session summaries or state records;

• selective session-history indexing;

• retrieval of historical context on demand;

• a retrieval-augmented search layer for prior project sessions;

• a dedicated retrieval subagent for historical queries;

• repository-local or project-local indexes;

• or another mechanism Opus judges superior after inspecting the actual project.

If a retrieval layer is considered, Opus must explicitly evaluate:

• What information should be indexed or retained.

• What information should remain transient and never become persistent memory.

• How historical memory should be distinguished from current canonical truth.

• How provenance and source date should be preserved.

• How stale, superseded, contradictory, or obsolete historical information should be identified and prevented from silently overriding current approved decisions.

• Whether retrieval should occur automatically, only when requested, or only when relevance thresholds are met.

• Whether retrieval results should be treated as context, evidence, or merely historical reference.

• How the system should handle conflicts between historical session information and the current canonical corpus.

• Whether retrieval should be performed by the primary Opus context, a subagent, or another mechanism.

• What indexing, storage, maintenance, context, latency, and token costs the mechanism introduces.

• Whether those costs are justified by a measurable reduction in repeated work, repeated investigation, repeated errors, or lost project context.

• Whether the existing handoff, state, decision-record, and canonical-knowledge mechanisms already solve the problem sufficiently without introducing an additional retrieval layer.

• At what project scale, session volume, or recurrence threshold an additional historical-retrieval mechanism would become justified.

• What deletion, retention, privacy, and lifecycle rules would apply if historical session data were persistently stored.

The central requirement is:

Historical memory must improve continuity without becoming a competing source of truth.

Historical retrieval must therefore remain subordinate to the current canonical corpus and approved project decisions. Old session content must never become authoritative merely because it was retrieved successfully or because it contains a confident prior conclusion.

The resource principle also applies here: do not index, retrieve, or inject historical context merely because it is technically possible. Use additional context when it materially improves the quality, continuity, correctness, or efficiency of the work. Avoid persistent indexing, automatic retrieval, or context injection when the expected project benefit does not justify the added complexity, maintenance burden, latency, or token/context cost.

This is explicitly an Opus-dependent architectural question. Do not create a permanent session-memory system, indexing pipeline, RAG layer, retrieval subagent, or hook-based context-injection mechanism during this preparation phase. Opus should first inspect the actual project, existing continuity mechanisms, session volume, repository structure, and operational constraints, then determine whether a historical-retrieval layer is needed at all and, if so, what the minimum effective architecture should be.

For the purposes of this document, the desired outcome is not "full memory of everything that ever happened." The desired outcome is reliable, selective, provenance-aware continuity across sessions while preserving canonical authority, minimizing unnecessary context, and preventing historical noise from degrading current reasoning.

### B.12 — Product and Learning Experience Quality Before Visual Expression

**ADD — Strong candidate / operating principle, not canonical product or learning truth.**

The review chain now has a clear operating principle that should guide product, learning-experience, and design reasoning without prematurely deciding any specific feature, page behavior, or visual direction:

> **Product and Learning Experience Quality precede Visual Expression. The interface should make AeroBridge's real instructional and operational value visible and usable; visual design must not compensate for weak content, weak learning mechanics, missing guidance, or unnecessary friction.**

> **Each surface should fulfill its core learner-facing job as completely and intelligently as justified by evidence. This does not mean every surface should do everything; it means each surface should earn its complexity through real learner value.**

This is intentionally an operating principle rather than a new learning-design rule. It does not authorize arbitrary feature expansion or override the existing ownership boundaries: the Learning Design Specification remains authoritative for learning intent and mechanics, while the Learning Experience Architecture translates those approved mechanics into the learner-facing experience. The principle instead establishes the quality lens through which gaps, missing capabilities, unnecessary friction, and proposed improvements should be evaluated.

The intended implication is that a visually strong page is not considered successful merely because its presentation is polished. The underlying learner-facing experience must first provide strong, useful, evidence-justified instructional and operational value.

### B.11 — File classification: confirmed sound; one addition

The nine/two/one/three tier table from the Convergence Report already avoids the trap this task specifically warns about — it does not call the Learning Foundation or Visual Design Execution Brief documents "canonical." **One addition:** whether the Roadmap's stale count should be corrected now or left for Karim's own later pass is itself a small, low-stakes **Karim-decision, not an Opus-dependent one** — Opus reviewing the corpus doesn't need this fixed first to do its job, so there's no reason to gate anything on it.

---

## The Sonnet-to-Opus Handoff

### What this preparation phase has actually done

Consolidated the available evidence and prior project knowledge; re-tested the five prior passes rather than inheriting them; independently adjudicated ChatGPT's twelve observations rather than accepting or rejecting them by default; found and corrected genuine factual errors (Skills sync mechanics), overclaims (`opusplan`'s context behavior), and placement gaps (the canonical-file mirror, hook coverage) where evidence justified it; separated established findings from candidates from questions that must wait for Opus; and produced the strongest responsible pre-Opus evidence and recommendation package achievable without the actual project corpus in front of the reviewer.

### What this preparation phase has deliberately not done

Not approved or canonicalized anything. Not decided the final Skills architecture, which Skills should ultimately be built, the final Plugin set, or the final repository structure. Not implemented, installed, or configured any Skill, Plugin, Hook, MCP connector, or Cowork automation. Not treated any recommendation here as an execution order. Not assumed that anything recommended in this chain is necessarily the strongest solution once the real corpus is actually inspected — several specific items are explicitly flagged **Opus-dependent** for exactly this reason.

### Opus's actual mission

Not "review this report." **Opus's task is to use this report as a preparation brief, then independently design and specify the strongest AI working environment and its implementation approach for AeroBridge** — determining how to coordinate Opus itself, Sonnet, Claude Code, Claude Design, Skills, Plugins, Hooks/rules, project knowledge, context management, verification/escalation, and any other materially relevant capability. Actual configuration, installation, repository changes, and implementation remain subject to approved execution scope and Karim's authority — Opus's design/specification role here does not itself carry execution authority. This is not a mandate to use every available feature — several genuine capabilities are recommended here as **not justified**, and Opus may find the strongest environment is simpler than anything proposed in this chain. The objective is maximum justified project performance, not maximum feature usage.

### Authority chain

Sonnet recommends. ChatGPT advises. Opus analyzes and recommends. Specialist tools (Claude Code, Claude Design, Cowork) execute according to approved scope. **Karim remains final human authority.** No AI recommendation — from any of the three — becomes an approved project decision merely by appearing in this report.

### Budget constraint, restated as a hard boundary

Claude Pro only. No additional paid subscription, no unplanned paid usage credits. A capability that is technically available but requires payment beyond the flat plan fee is outside the approved environment regardless of how attractive it looks — this is not weakened anywhere in this document to make the proposed architecture appear stronger (the Fable REJECT, §B.5, is the direct application of this).

### Intended project lifecycle after this preparation phase

A planning model, explicitly not a locked commitment — Opus may resequence it if project evidence supports a better order:

1. Sonnet completes this preparation brief.
2. Opus designs and improves the candidate operating environment (including its own operating method, and how Sonnet/Skills/Plugins/Claude Code/Claude Design/verification mechanisms should actually be used).
3. Opus uses that improved environment to independently inspect the real AeroBridge corpus, refining or replacing this report's recommendations where the evidence warrants.
4. Once product/learning/architecture decisions are sufficiently mature, Claude Design enters its design phase.

Claude Design Operating Recommendations — AeroBridge

Purpose

Claude Design should be treated as a visual execution, exploration, verification, prototyping, and handoff environment for AeroBridge.

It is not, by default, the source of product truth, domain truth, architecture truth, curriculum truth, or canonical decision authority.

Its purpose is to transform relevant AeroBridge intent, specifications, design rules, assets, references, and constraints into coherent visual and interactive artifacts; support efficient visual exploration and iteration; and produce artifacts that can be handed off into implementation.

Claude Design should increase the quality and speed of execution without replacing AeroBridge's governing knowledge, decision process, or human judgment.

---

I. AUTHORITY, TRUTH, AND DECISION BOUNDARIES

1. Establish the Relevant Truth Before Visual Execution

Do not use Claude Design to invent fundamental AeroBridge product decisions when those decisions have not yet been properly reasoned through.

Where applicable, establish the relevant source of truth through the governing AeroBridge process:

Evidence → Intent → Verification → Decision → Canonicalization

Claude Design should consume the relevant approved or intentionally exploratory inputs rather than silently replacing them.

### 1A. Product and Learning Experience Quality Before Visual Expression

Visual design should reveal and reinforce validated product and learning value; it should not be used to compensate for unresolved weaknesses in content, learning mechanics, or learner workflow.

Claude Design may surface a content, interaction, or workflow weakness when visual exploration exposes it, but it should not hide that weakness through polish or decoration. Where such a weakness materially affects the experience, it should be surfaced through the appropriate product/learning review path before being treated as a solved visual problem.

---

2. Distinguish Binding Constraints From Revisable Guidance

Not every statement in the project has equal authority.

Classify relevant inputs into at least these categories:

Binding / Hard Constraints

These must be respected unless an explicit decision changes them.

Examples may include:

- canonical assets
- immutable technical constraints
- confirmed architecture constraints
- explicitly approved product requirements
- explicitly locked UX decisions
- approved non-negotiable rules

Approved but Revisable Guidance

These should guide execution but may be reconsidered if better evidence or a materially stronger design emerges.

Examples may include:

- visual principles
- layout preferences
- component preferences
- stylistic guidance
- interaction conventions that are not explicitly locked

Exploratory / Provisional Material

These are intentionally open to experimentation.

Historical / Implementation Evidence

Existing code, old screens, previous drafts, and historical artifacts may inform understanding, but are not automatically authoritative.

---

3. Treat Canonical and Hard Constraints as Binding

Treat canonical and hard constraints as binding.

Treat non-canonical design guidance as revisable.

When a generated design appears materially better but conflicts with a non-binding or provisional decision, surface the conflict and evaluate whether the decision itself should be revised rather than rejecting the design automatically.

Do not allow a visually strong result to override a genuinely binding constraint silently.

Do not reject a genuinely strong design merely because it differs from an old, provisional, or non-binding preference.

The correct response to a meaningful conflict is:

Surface → Evaluate → Decide → Canonicalize if approved

not:

Ignore the conflict → silently adopt

and not:

Reject automatically

---

4. Claude Design Is an Execution Surface, Not a Source of Truth

Claude Design may generate:

- visual concepts
- layouts
- prototypes
- interactions
- design variations
- motion concepts
- presentations
- promotional artifacts
- implementation-ready visual structures

Generated output is not authoritative simply because it is polished.

A generated result becomes an approved AeroBridge artifact only through the appropriate review and decision process.

---

5. Preserve Human and Project-Level Design Authority

Claude may:

- generate alternatives
- identify possibilities
- translate high-level intent into concrete visual execution
- propose improvements
- explore variations

It does not automatically decide:

- what AeroBridge should become
- what should be canonical
- which non-binding direction should win
- which tradeoff the product should accept
- whether a product-level decision should change

Human/project authority remains responsible for final approval and canonicalization.

---

II. PREPARATION BEFORE CLAUDE DESIGN

6. Do Heavy Thinking Outside Claude Design When Practical

Use the general Claude environment or another appropriate tool for:

- brainstorming
- research
- strategy
- information architecture
- content planning
- requirements analysis
- UX reasoning
- design rationale
- specification writing
- alternative evaluation

Bring the refined result into Claude Design for visual execution.

Do not spend scarce Claude Design usage on work that does not require its visual capabilities.

---

7. Separate Specialized AI Responsibilities

A useful workflow is:

Reasoning / Research
→ strategy, research, structure, content, specifications

Claude Design
→ visual and interactive design execution

Specialized Asset Tools
→ images, video, motion, illustrations, or other assets when useful

Claude Code
→ implementation, integration, debugging, deployment, and technical iteration

Do not force one tool to perform every stage when specialization produces a better workflow.

---

8. Optimize for Total Workflow Cost, Not Prompt Length

Do not optimize merely for short prompts.

Optimize for the total amount of work required to reach the correct result.

A longer, well-structured specification may be cheaper overall if it prevents:

- wrong initial direction
- repeated corrections
- unnecessary regeneration
- context pollution
- failed iterations
- wasted design usage

A vague short prompt can be much more expensive than a detailed but high-value specification.

---

9. Give Claude High-Value Context, Not Maximum Context

More context is not automatically better.

Provide only the context that materially improves the current task, such as:

- relevant design rules
- relevant screen/product specification
- required content
- necessary assets
- relevant references
- sketch
- explicit constraints
- explicit exclusions

Do not automatically provide the entire AeroBridge repository or every project document.

Irrelevant context can increase ambiguity and increase the chance of mixing current, historical, proposed, or superseded information.

The rule is:

Relevant inputs up front; irrelevant context out.

---

10. Existing Implementation Is Evidence, Not Automatic Authority

An existing AeroBridge repository, screen, component, or implementation may be useful as a reference.

However:

Existing implementation = evidence

Approved specification / canonical knowledge = authority

Do not infer that the current implementation is correct merely because Claude Design can inspect it.

---

11. Use Explicit Product and Screen Specifications for Complex Work

For substantial interfaces, prepare a structured specification where useful.

It may include:

- purpose
- user
- context
- hierarchy
- content
- interactions
- states
- responsive behavior
- relevant design rules
- constraints
- exclusions
- required assets
- acceptance expectations

A sufficiently strong specification may eliminate the need for a separate wireframe.

---

III. DESIGN SYSTEM AND VISUAL CONSISTENCY

12. Maintain One Authoritative AeroBridge Design System

Use one authoritative AeroBridge Design System as the primary visual foundation unless the product explicitly requires multiple systems.

Do not create competing systems for the same product without a real product-level reason.

Where applicable, the Design System should cover:

- typography
- colors
- spacing
- layout conventions
- surfaces
- components
- buttons
- cards
- icons
- borders
- states
- hierarchy
- density
- motion principles
- emphasis
- usage constraints
- allowed variation

---

13. Treat the Design System as Cross-Artifact Infrastructure

The Design System should maintain visual continuity across:

- product screens
- learning experiences
- practice experiences
- prototypes
- demonstrations
- presentations
- supporting documentation
- approved promotional artifacts
- future related product surfaces

Its value is not merely screen-level consistency.

It should allow new artifacts to inherit the same visual language rather than independently reinventing it.

---

14. Consistency Does Not Mean Repetition

A Design System defines a visual grammar; it should not make every section look identical.

Use controlled variation to create:

- hierarchy
- rhythm
- emphasis
- depth
- visual interest

The goal is:

consistent + purposeful

not:

consistent + repetitive

Avoid the failure mode in which the Design System is applied mechanically and produces a flat or lifeless result.

---

15. Do Not Use Defaults Blindly

Default AI-generated choices frequently produce generic or recognizable AI-style results.

Do not rely blindly on default choices for:

- typography
- colors
- layouts
- generic SaaS patterns
- generic cards
- generic hero sections
- generic copy
- generic visual effects
- generic motion

AeroBridge's system, intent, references, and constraints should drive the result.

---

16. Protect Canonical Brand Assets

Canonical visual assets such as approved logos or marks should be treated as protected inputs.

Unless explicitly authorized:

- preserve the source asset
- do not redraw it
- do not reinterpret geometry
- do not simplify it
- do not alter proportions
- do not recolor it
- do not invent substitute variants

Claude Design has demonstrated that generated logos can drift from supplied source assets.

Do not assume that a visually plausible regenerated logo is acceptable.

---

17. Distinguish Immutable From Flexible Design Decisions

Clearly identify which decisions are:

Immutable / Protected

Examples:

- canonical logo
- locked brand assets
- explicitly fixed typography rules
- explicitly fixed navigation rules
- hard product hierarchy decisions
- explicitly prohibited patterns

Flexible / Exploratory

Examples:

- permitted layout variations
- density within an approved range
- accent intensity
- texture
- motion treatment
- section rhythm
- allowed component variations
- other intentionally open visual parameters

Claude should know the difference rather than treating every preference as equally rigid.

---

18. Update the System When a System-Level Decision Changes

If a decision is intentionally approved at system level — for example a change to:

- logo
- typography
- colors
- button behavior
- reusable component treatment

update the authoritative Design System rather than manually fixing every downstream artifact independently.

The central system should remain the reusable source for future work.

---

IV. REFERENCES, SKETCHES, AND DESIGN INPUTS

19. Reference, Don't Merely Describe

When possible, provide:

- screenshots
- interface references
- exact examples
- sketches
- real components
- visual references
- interaction references

Prefer concrete references over vague adjectives such as:

- modern
- premium
- clean
- beautiful
- minimal
- professional

Concrete references reduce interpretive ambiguity.

---

20. Use a "Reference + Constraints + Intent" Pattern

A strong Claude Design task often has three layers:

Reference
→ what is useful to observe

Constraints
→ what must and must not change

Intent
→ what the result is supposed to accomplish

This is stronger than relying only on descriptive prose.

---

21. State What to Preserve and What to Replace

When using an external reference, do not simply say:

«"Make it like this."»

Specify:

Preserve

- interaction pattern
- structural behavior
- motion concept
- spatial rhythm
- useful component idea

Replace

- branding
- colors
- typography
- copy
- assets
- component treatment
- product-specific behavior

External references are patterns and inspiration, not AeroBridge identity.

---

21A. Treat Prior AeroBridge Visual Explorations as Taste and Intent References, Not Design Authority

Previous AeroBridge screenshots, mockups, generated images, and visual explorations may be provided to Claude Design as references for prior human taste, intent, experimentation, and visual direction.

These artifacts are not automatically canonical, approved, or binding, and they must not be treated as a target to reproduce or merely "improve."

When such references are provided, Claude Design should:

- identify what the reference is trying to achieve
- distinguish strong and reusable visual principles from incidental implementation details
- identify elements that appear weak, generic, artificial, dated, or inconsistent with the current product and learning context
- preserve useful intent where justified
- remain free to depart substantially from the reference when a stronger direction is supported by the current AeroBridge truth, intent, constraints, and design requirements
- avoid optimizing for visual similarity to the reference unless similarity itself is explicitly an approved requirement

The intended transformation is:

Prior AeroBridge Exploration → Extracted Intent / Useful Principles → Re-evaluation → New AeroBridge Design

not:

Prior AeroBridge Exploration → Mandatory Template → Refinement

When prior explorations conflict with binding constraints, current product/learning requirements, or the relevant Design System, the conflict must be surfaced rather than silently preserved.

When a prior exploration represents only a provisional or personal preference, Claude Design may use it to understand taste without treating it as a decision.

The purpose of providing prior visual explorations is to reduce ambiguity about human taste and prior intent without sacrificing design exploration or allowing historical visual work to become accidental design authority.

---

22. Use Inspiration at Page Level and Component Level

Page-Level Inspiration

May inform:

- composition
- scroll journey
- motion
- background behavior
- section rhythm

Component-Level Inspiration

May inform:

- buttons
- borders
- announcements
- transitions
- animated elements
- individual components

Use references to extract useful patterns rather than blindly reproducing the source.

---

23. Translate Inspiration Into AeroBridge Rather Than Cloning It

The intended transformation is:

Reference → abstraction → AeroBridge adaptation

not:

Reference → visual clone

A strong external reference may justify reconsidering a non-binding design decision, but it does not silently override AeroBridge's binding constraints.

---

24. Use Sketches as Spatial Constraints and Alignment Artifacts

A sketch is useful when you already understand the intended composition.

Use it to communicate:

- placement
- relative proportions
- hierarchy
- regions
- alignment
- image/video areas
- hero structure
- navigation position
- major content blocks

A sketch does not need to be polished.

Its purpose is to reduce spatial ambiguity and get Claude aligned with the intended composition.

A sketch is both:

a spatial constraint

and

an alignment/communication artifact.

---

25. Choose Wireframe vs High-Fidelity Based on Uncertainty

Do not wireframe merely because it is a traditional process step.

Use wireframes when there is genuine uncertainty around:

- information architecture
- flow
- page sequence
- interaction structure
- complex application layouts
- multi-screen journeys
- funnels
- structural alternatives

Go directly to high fidelity when the structure is already sufficiently understood and the main uncertainty is visual execution.

A strong product specification or sketch may make a wireframe unnecessary.

---

V. ASSETS, MOTION, AND MULTI-TOOL WORKFLOW

26. Specify Assets for Their Destination, Not Just Their Appearance

When generating an external asset, specify:

- aspect ratio
- placement
- intended background
- text-safe area
- movement behavior
- loop behavior
- visual density
- mobile constraints
- whether text is allowed inside the asset

The asset should be designed for its actual composition context.

---

27. Use Specialized Tools for Specialized Assets

A useful chain may be:

Claude / planning
→ asset concept and prompt

Image/Video/Motion Tool
→ asset

Claude Design
→ composition and integration

Do not force Claude Design to generate every asset when another tool is better suited.

---

28. Upload Relevant Assets Early

When assets materially improve the task, provide them early:

- approved logos
- screenshots
- sketches
- videos
- illustrations
- specifications
- references

Relevant inputs early can reduce repeated explanation and correction.

Do not upload irrelevant project material merely for completeness.

---

29. Use Section-by-Section Asset Planning for Large Artifacts

For a large website or complex experience, do not think:

«"I have to design the whole thing."»

Break it down:

Section → identify need → generate/source asset → integrate → inspect → iterate

Claude can help propose what type of visual, motion, interaction, or supporting asset may strengthen an individual section.

This reduces cognitive overload and makes iteration manageable.

---

VI. GENERATION, MONITORING, AND ITERATION

30. Monitor Claude While It Is Building

Do not blindly let a long generation run.

Watch for:

- wrong interpretation
- unauthorized visual direction
- missing required content
- generic patterns
- hierarchy problems
- misuse of the Design System
- invented product content
- incorrect asset usage

The visible trajectory matters.

---

31. Stop Wrong Trajectories Early

If Claude is clearly heading in the wrong direction:

Stop → correct → continue

Do not wait until an entire wrong implementation is complete.

Early correction reduces:

- wasted generation
- unnecessary output
- rework
- quota consumption
- context pollution

---

32. Treat Verification as a Distinct Layer

Claude Design's visual verification is useful for:

- layout problems
- obvious inconsistencies
- malformed elements
- missing visual details
- rendered issues

But verification does not replace:

- UX review
- product review
- domain review
- curriculum review
- architecture review
- final human approval

---

33. QA During Generation and After Generation

Do not wait for the final state before checking quality.

Use:

Generate → Observe → Verify → Correct → Continue

then after completion:

Inspect → Test → Approve or Iterate

---

34. Use Direct Editing for Precise Local Changes

When the desired element is clear, direct editing or inline editing is usually more precise than another broad prompt.

Use it for:

- text
- size
- color
- spacing
- exact element properties

This reduces ambiguity and unnecessary regeneration.

---

35. Reference the Exact Element Whenever Possible

If an element can be directly selected, edited, or commented on, prefer that to describing where it is in prose.

This gives Claude a much more precise target.

---

36. Use Draw / Annotation for Spatial Problems

Draw or annotation is particularly useful for:

- regions
- backgrounds
- transitions
- spatial relationships
- areas that do not correspond to a clear selectable element

Do not use draw when direct element editing is simpler.

---

37. Use Interactive Tweaks as a Controlled Exploration Layer

When Claude Design provides visual parameters or variations, use them to explore:

- palette
- accent intensity
- typography
- section rhythm
- spacing
- layout
- texture
- card treatment
- hierarchy
- other allowed parameters

Tweaks are especially useful when you know the result needs improvement but do not yet know which exact treatment is best.

---

38. Prefer Tweaks Over Prompt/Revert Loops for Suitable Questions

For questions such as:

«"What happens if the font is larger?"»

«"What happens if section spacing is tighter?"»

«"What happens if the accent is stronger?"»

use the interactive tweak layer where appropriate instead of repeatedly:

prompt → regenerate → inspect → reject → prompt → regenerate

This can reduce unnecessary prompt churn and quota consumption.

---

39. Do Not Automatically Canonicalize a Successful Tweak

A tweak that looks good in one screen is not automatically a system rule.

Only promote it to the AeroBridge Design System if it is intentionally approved as a reusable system-level decision.

---

40. Iterate in Focused Chunks

Do not overload one revision prompt with many unrelated changes.

Prefer:

one major visual change

or

one tightly related cluster

per iteration.

Large multi-change prompts can cause some changes to be missed, weakened, or inconsistently implemented.

---

41. Use One Major Visual Dimension Per Prompt

For substantial visual iteration, isolate the primary change.

Examples:

- hierarchy
- typography
- section rhythm
- accent treatment
- surface depth
- motion treatment

Do not create mega-prompts containing many unrelated visual transformations unless the task genuinely requires a coordinated transformation.

---

42. Use Negative Constraints

Tell Claude what must not happen, not only what should happen.

Useful negatives may include:

- unwanted fonts
- unwanted colors
- generic SaaS patterns
- visual clutter
- prohibited components
- unnecessary effects
- wrong branding
- invented domain content
- unwanted motion

Preventing an unwanted direction early is often cheaper than correcting it later.

---

43. High-Level Creative Direction Is Valid

Not every prompt needs to be technical.

Creative direction can be expressed through intent such as:

- create a stronger sense of progression
- make the transition more engaging
- add depth without clutter
- make the experience feel calm
- create a stronger sense of focus

Claude may translate high-level creative intent into concrete visual or motion implementation.

However, the intent remains constrained by AeroBridge's approved design boundaries.

---

44. Do Not Confuse First-Pass Success With Completion

A first pass is a working hypothesis.

Expect:

- visual corrections
- interaction fixes
- layout refinement
- responsive changes
- copy refinement
- asset corrections
- pacing adjustments

The correct expectation is iterative refinement, not one-shot perfection.

---

45. Iteration Continues After Implementation

Design refinement may continue after:

- prototype generation
- implementation
- deployment
- first users
- real feedback

The system should support continued improvement without casually destroying canonical rules.

---

VII. PROTOTYPES, FLOWS, AND QA

46. Prototype Interaction, Not Only Appearance

For complex AeroBridge flows, static screenshots are insufficient.

Use interactive prototypes when evaluating:

- navigation
- Terminal interactions
- practice flows
- scenario flows
- assessment flows
- transitions
- responsive states
- multi-step journeys

Evaluate whether the experience works, not merely whether it looks good.

---

47. Review Visual and Behavioral Correctness Separately

Visual QA

- hierarchy
- typography
- spacing
- composition
- consistency
- polish

Behavioral QA

- buttons
- navigation
- state transitions
- links
- interaction feedback
- flow completion

Visual polish does not prove interaction correctness.

---

48. Mock Data Has Boundaries in AeroBridge

Mock data may be used where it is purely visual and non-semantic.

Do not invent domain-sensitive material to make a prototype look complete.

Do not invent:

- Amadeus commands
- syntax
- procedural rules
- domain semantics
- unsupported training claims
- canonical curriculum content
- assessment logic
- canonical product behavior

Where real content is not yet approved, use explicit placeholders.

---

VIII. CROSS-ARTIFACT CONSISTENCY AND HANDOFF

49. Build a Consistent Artifact Family

Once an artifact establishes a successful visual language, reuse the same system for related artifacts.

Examples:

Product screen → subpage → prototype → presentation → supporting visual

Consistency should be systemic, not manually recreated each time.

---

50. Export Design Artifacts for Portability

The design should not remain trapped inside Claude Design.

Where useful, export or hand off to:

- Claude Code
- repositories
- Figma
- Canva
- PowerPoint
- other appropriate implementation/design environments

The design artifact is a production intermediate, not necessarily the final destination.

---

51. Claude Design → Claude Code Is a Handoff, Not a Governance Transfer

Claude Design may produce implementation-ready output.

Claude Code may continue the work and make the product real.

However, authority does not transfer.

Claude Code must still respect:

- AeroBridge architecture
- canonical decisions
- product rules
- design rules
- approved content
- engineering constraints

A generated design cannot silently redefine those systems.

---

52. Use Claude Code When the Remaining Work No Longer Requires Claude Design

Move to Claude Code when the remaining work is primarily:

- code
- implementation
- logic
- integration
- debugging
- deployment
- straightforward implementation changes

Return to Claude Design when visual execution, visual exploration, or interactive design review adds meaningful value.

---

IX. LOCAL, PRODUCTION, AND RESPONSIVE WORKFLOW

53. Maintain Separate Development and Production Environments

Use a separation such as:

Local / Development
→ experiment
→ iterate
→ test

Repository / Controlled Source
→ approved implementation state

Production
→ deployed public artifact

Do not treat the live environment as the main experimentation surface.

---

54. Verify Locally Before Deployment

Before production deployment:

- run the build
- open it
- verify rendering
- verify assets
- verify interactions
- verify links
- inspect responsive states

Do not equate successful generation with production readiness.

---

55. Verify the Actual Production URL After Deployment

Deployment is not proof of success.

Use:

Deploy → open real URL → test → identify failure → fix → redeploy → verify again

Check for:

- broken routing
- missing files
- wrong paths
- missing assets
- runtime failures
- layout failures

---

56. Treat Production Errors as Real Feedback

Use observed production failures as concrete inputs to Claude Code.

Preferred loop:

Observed failure → diagnose → fix → redeploy → verify

Do not guess when the actual failure can be inspected.

---

57. Test Responsive Behavior Explicitly

Do not assume that a desktop result automatically becomes a good mobile result.

Explicitly inspect:

- desktop
- mobile
- tablet where relevant

Check:

- layout
- typography
- overflow
- video/image behavior
- navigation
- interactions
- spacing
- hierarchy

For AeroBridge, mobile-first requirements should be incorporated during design and implementation, not treated merely as a post-launch correction.

---

X. CONTEXT AND USAGE MANAGEMENT

58. Treat Claude Design Usage as a Separate Operational Budget

Claude Design usage should be treated as a finite resource.

Do not waste it on:

- unnecessary brainstorming
- unnecessary exploration
- avoidable rework
- overly broad prompts
- repeated corrections
- tasks better suited to another tool

Usage optimization should support quality rather than replace it.

---

59. Use Model-by-Stage

Do not automatically use the most expensive model for every action.

A practical pattern may be:

Higher-capability model
→ initial planning
→ high ambiguity
→ difficult transformation
→ important creative direction

Lower-cost capable model
→ routine iteration
→ straightforward refinements
→ minor visual changes

Model selection should follow task difficulty and ambiguity.

---

60. Better Specifications Can Reduce Model Requirements

When the task becomes:

- well specified
- well referenced
- strongly constrained
- asset-complete
- explicit about negatives

a less expensive capable model may be able to execute much of the task effectively.

Improve the task specification before assuming more model power is required.

---

61. Manage Context Deliberately

Very long sessions can become inefficient or harder to control.

When a project becomes excessively long or its context begins to lose clarity, consider:

Export current artifact → start a fresh focused session → continue from the artifact

Do not repeatedly rebuild from zero.

A fresh session should inherit the latest usable artifact and relevant instructions rather than the entire historical conversation.

Do not assume that a UI-level context-clearing command necessarily removes all underlying context or usage cost unless verified.

---

62. Use Focused Sessions for Focused Tasks

Separate sessions can be useful for distinct requests such as:

- strategy
- research
- design system
- screen design
- prototype refinement
- motion
- implementation handoff

This reduces unnecessary context accumulation and makes each environment more specialized.

---

63. Use Claude Code When Claude Design Quota Is Exhausted

If Claude Design usage is exhausted but implementation work can continue:

Export current artifact → continue in Claude Code

Continue development there until Claude Design becomes useful again.

When needed, return to Claude Design for subsequent visual work.

---

64. Use Manual Tools When They Are Faster and More Precise

Do not use AI merely because AI is available.

If a task can be completed significantly faster or more accurately by:

- Canva
- Figma
- PowerPoint
- direct editing
- another specialized tool

use the appropriate tool.

The goal is efficient, accurate production — not maximum AI usage.

A five-second manual correction may be better than several AI iterations that consume time and quota.

---

XI. RECOMMENDED AEROBRIDGE OPERATING LOOP

65. Preferred Claude Design Workflow

For substantial AeroBridge visual tasks, use:

Canonical / Relevant Truth
→ Approved or Intentional Design Direction
→ Relevant Design System
→ Specification
→ References / Sketch / Assets / Negative Constraints
→ Model Selection
→ Generate
→ Monitor Trajectory
→ Interrupt Early if Wrong
→ Visual Verification
→ Human Review
→ Focused Iteration
→ Interaction QA
→ Responsive QA
→ Approval / Decision
→ Canonicalize if System-Level
→ Export / Handoff
→ Claude Code
→ Local QA
→ Production
→ Production QA
→ Real Feedback
→ Governed Iteration

---

XII. FINAL OPERATING PRINCIPLES

66. Optimize for Total Workflow Quality

The objective is not to maximize:

- prompts
- AI usage
- model power
- visual complexity
- number of iterations

The objective is to maximize:

quality + accuracy + consistency + speed + maintainability

within AeroBridge's governing constraints.

---

67. Use AI for What AI Is Good At

Claude Design is particularly valuable for:

- rapid visual exploration
- transforming structured intent into design
- generating prototypes
- visual variations
- interactive experiments
- motion concepts
- cross-artifact consistency
- fast design iteration

Do not use it merely because it exists.

---

68. Preserve Product Truth While Allowing Design Evolution

The correct philosophy is neither:

«"Claude must obey every old design decision forever."»

nor:

«"Claude is free to redesign anything it wants."»

Instead:

«Binding constraints remain binding. Non-binding guidance can evolve. Strong generated alternatives should surface conflicts and can trigger deliberate reconsideration of the underlying decision.»

This preserves both governance and creative evolution.

---

69. Final Principle

Claude Design should not be treated as:

"the system that designs AeroBridge."

It should be treated as:

"a high-leverage visual design and prototyping environment that receives the right truth, intent, references, constraints, and assets; explores and executes within the appropriate boundaries; verifies its own visual output; supports focused human-guided iteration; and hands approved results into implementation."

The goal is not maximum AI autonomy.

The goal is maximum useful leverage without losing product control, design quality, or decision integrity.

Karim reviews and approves the visual direction.

6. Claude Code implements, using the approved environment, architecture, and design direction.
7. Cowork enters the workflow only if Opus independently determines it provides concrete project value — not by default inclusion.

---

## Candidate Operating Model for Opus

Per this task's own requirement, this is a proposed starting point for Opus to adopt, modify, or replace — not a decision. Classifications in the final column use the same three-tier vocabulary defined above (Established now / Strong candidate / Opus-dependent); "Not currently justified" is retained only as a decision-status label for exclusions, kept distinct from the three knowledge tiers. Each row: Capability → Role → Trigger → Context needed → Verification → Escalation path → Cost/complexity → Expected benefit → Classification.

| Capability | Role | Trigger | Context needed | Verification | Escalation | Cost | Benefit | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opus, direct reasoning | Primary reasoner for planning, architecture, adversarial review, and adjudicating between conflicting recommendations | Irreversible/high-consequence work; architecture-level questions | The specific artifact/question plus relevant canonical files, not the full corpus by default | Cross-checked against canonical sources when the task's risk, claim type, uncertainty, or consequence warrants it — not mechanically on every instance | This is the top of the chain | Highest per-token; used selectively | Highest-confidence output where it matters most | **Established:** this is the intended role/decision principle for the future operating model. **Opus-dependent / not yet demonstrated:** actual effectiveness, workflow integration, context strategy, and real performance once applied to the real AeroBridge corpus — none of this is proven by stating the role. |
| Opus → Sonnet delegation | **Established principle:** Opus can delegate appropriately bounded work to Sonnet once a plan/spec exists and remaining work is its mechanical application. **Available platform pattern:** `opusplan`/advisor-style coordination is one current way this could be operationalized. **Still open:** the exact future AeroBridge delegation architecture, subject to Opus's own inspection, validation, and project context. | Once a plan exists and remaining work is its mechanical application | The plan plus the specific files touched | Tests where they exist; output checked against the plan's own acceptance criteria before being treated as done | Back to Opus (advisor or fresh plan) if execution surfaces an ambiguity the plan didn't anticipate | Low per-unit — the efficient default | Throughput without sacrificing the plan's own rigor | **Established now** (the delegation principle); **Strong candidate** (`opusplan`/advisor as one current pattern for it, not the locked mechanism) |
| Opus coordinating Claude Code | Sets architecture/spec using `opusplan` or another Opus/Sonnet coordination mode selected after validation; Claude Code executes with advisor escalation for execution-time uncertainty | Any Claude Code work | Approved spec + task-relevant canonical files, via the repository-local access mechanism | File 08's existing Verification Loop, unchanged | Advisor mid-task; a genuinely separate session for independence-sensitive decisions | As previously costed | Architecture-level coherence without Opus personally executing every line | **Established now** (that some coordination mode is needed) / **Strong candidate** (`opusplan` specifically, where retained as the chosen mechanism) |
| Opus coordinating Claude Design | Exact role not yet fixed — may review, coordinate, propose, generate alternatives, or take another design-support role once Design Execution reopens and something exists to evaluate | Once Design Execution reopens and something exists to evaluate | The proposal plus file 04's principles and the Visual Design Execution Brief (a noncanonical strategic/design input, not the historical tokens by default) | The evaluation criteria those documents already state | Karim — final visual authority is explicitly his, regardless of which of these roles Opus ends up taking | Low (a review pass) | An informed second opinion Karim can weigh, without displacing his authority | **Established now:** Karim retains final visual authority. **Opus-dependent:** the exact shape of Opus's own role |
| Skills for repeated workflows | Encode a procedure only once it has genuinely recurred and its shape is known | The existing Skill/Plugin/Hook/Rule test (third-pass §13) | N/A until built | Tested against real tasks post-creation, not trusted on creation alone (see the validation lifecycle below) | N/A | Authoring + maintenance — hence the repetition bar | Consistency, reduced repeated context, once justified | Methodology **Strong candidate**; every specific instance **Opus-dependent** |
| General evidence/anti-fabrication discipline (extended beyond Amadeus) | Prevent any high-risk claim — technical, product, engineering, behavioral, not only domain — from being asserted with more confidence than its evidence supports | Any claim whose consequence of being wrong is high | Whatever the claim concerns | Traces to a canonical source, a test result, or an explicit UNKNOWN/VERIFY/ESCALATE label | The three-tier discipline this document models throughout | Near-free as a principle; what it prevents is expensive | A foundational, high-value property this whole chain protects | Principle **Established now**; enforcement mechanism (Skill/Hook/rule/workflow) **Opus-dependent** |
| Protecting Karim from technical mistakes he can't independently catch | The same evidence discipline applied to code/architecture/security/dependencies | Any technically consequential Claude Code work | The specific change plus its test coverage | Actual test execution, not "the code looks right" or any single mechanism's mere existence | Advisor, for anything Sonnet's own confidence shouldn't be trusted on alone | Testing is inherent to building anything correctly; specific mechanism cost as separately assessed | Structural compensation for a gap Karim can't close himself | **Requirement: Established now.** Current candidate mechanisms (`code-review`, the security plugins, advisor escalation) are **Strong candidate**, not proof of correctness on their own — per §B.7, they remain pending Opus/project validation, and testing/actual validation are the operative evidence, never the plugins' mere presence. **Exact final enforcement architecture: Opus-dependent.** |
| Cowork | Narrow, non-canonical document/scheduling tasks under the four established bounds | A genuinely recurring need in that narrow category | N/A beyond the specific task | Human review before anything derived from it is treated as decided | N/A | Shares the shared usage pool | Real but modest | **Strong candidate** — Opus should independently confirm it still earns a place once real recurring instances (or their absence) are visible |
| Agent Teams, MCP connectors, community-marketplace plugins, Find Skill tools, Fable | None currently | None met | — | — | — | — | — | **Not currently justified** |
| Opus's own reasoning discipline — planning, decomposition, evidence-first investigation, root-cause analysis, iterative verification, adversarial self-challenge, recovery from failed approaches, explicit uncertainty handling, long-horizon tracking | Applied proportionately to task consequence, never uniformly | Task risk, not task type | Whatever the task requires | The same tiered discipline this document models | Self-contained — this is the top of the chain | Scales with stakes, not a flat tax on everything | Matches reasoning depth to actual risk instead of over- or under-investing | **Established:** the project requires/recommends these principles, applied proportionately. **Opus-dependent:** their exact operationalization, weighting, sequencing, context/application rules, and actual effectiveness once realized inside AeroBridge work — specifying these principles here is not proof Opus will successfully perform them. |

### Performance objective: quality first, efficiency second — and this applies to Opus's own realized performance, not only the environment around it

This requirement concerns two things together, not one: the operating environment surrounding Opus, and Opus's own realized reasoning and execution performance within that environment. The objective is not merely a cleaner workflow around Opus — it is to maximize Opus's actual useful performance for AeroBridge, evaluating and, where justified, adopting any capability, workflow pattern, reasoning discipline, tool, mode, or coordination mechanism that materially improves its results.

The table above already applies proportionate-to-risk reasoning throughout; stated as an explicit principle rather than left implicit: **more reasoning, more checking, more tools, and more context are not automatically better — but neither is minimizing them when doing so would materially reduce correctness, depth, usefulness, or project value.** The correct priority order is quality first, efficiency second: when additional reasoning, context, verification, tools, time, or cost materially improves correctness or usefulness, accept that cost rather than sacrificing quality to save it; when additional resource usage would not produce a meaningful improvement, avoid the unnecessary cost and complexity. The objective is neither minimum nor maximum resource usage — it is **maximum justified project quality, with resource efficiency applied only where it does not compromise that quality.** Verification depth should track the actual consequence of being wrong, not a fixed number of self-review passes applied uniformly regardless of stakes. This does not weaken the existing budget constraint, and does not imply unlimited resource usage is desirable — it means spending additional resources when they buy meaningful quality, and saving them when they do not.

**On the specific question of importing operating characteristics from other strong long-horizon/agentic systems, including Fable 5.1:** the characteristics worth evaluating — deeper task planning, stronger decomposition, persistent goal tracking, evidence-first investigation, deliberate tool use, root-cause analysis, proportionate iterative verification, adversarial self-challenge, recovery from failed approaches, disciplined escalation — are not unique to any one system. They are general, well-established properties of strong agentic reasoning, and the right question is whether *each one specifically* improves Opus's performance on AeroBridge's actual tasks — never whether Opus should imitate Fable, be assumed equivalent to it, or adopt a capability merely because another system has it. This document does not assume any of them are free: several carry a real risk of unnecessary context consumption, over-verification, latency, or added complexity if applied without the same risk-proportionality already stated above. **Classification: the general principle (evaluate these characteristics on their individual, evidence-supported merit) is Established now; which specific ones to adopt, to what degree, and how they're weighted or sequenced is Opus-dependent** — this document doesn't pre-select them, consistent with not pre-selecting Skills or Plugins elsewhere. The governing question throughout is "what would most improve Opus's performance on AeroBridge," never "how do we make Opus behave like another model."

### Trustworthiness requirement — generalized beyond Amadeus

**Established as a core project requirement, mechanism deliberately left open:** the environment should structurally guard against, and prevent where practicable, guesses, generic model knowledge, plausible assumptions, unverified external claims, inferred system behavior, behavior borrowed from another product, or incomplete evidence being treated as authoritative — for any high-risk factual, technical, operational, product, engineering, or behavioral claim, not only Amadeus. No AI environment can guarantee perfect prevention of this under all circumstances; the requirement is to make unsupported claims non-authoritative and structurally disfavored, not to claim an impossible absolute guarantee. For Amadeus specifically, this already means never inventing command syntax, semantics, workflow order, preconditions, state transitions, responses, errors, recovery, or persistence behavior (file 05's own existing discipline, unchanged). Where evidence is insufficient, the environment should produce an explicit `UNKNOWN` / `VERIFY` / `ESCALATE` state rather than a plausible-sounding answer.

**This document does not decide the enforcement mechanism.** Whether this is best served by a Skill, a canonical rule, an operating rule, a Hook, a verification workflow, an evidence-tagging mechanism, or some combination is explicitly **Opus-dependent** — this is a requirement about the resulting environment's trustworthiness, not a prejudged answer about which tool enforces it.

### Designing for Karim's technical skill level — a requirement, not a simplification

Karim is not a technically experienced software engineer. **This raises the required standard, it does not lower it.** The environment must compensate structurally for a gap Karim cannot close himself: important code reviewed and tested rather than trusted because it looks plausible; architectural assumptions challenged and verified rather than accepted; security-sensitive or irreversible changes receiving stronger scrutiny; uncertain technical conclusions labeled as uncertain rather than presented as settled; difficult decisions escalated to stronger reasoning; validation and testing used as actual evidence of correctness, never model confidence; and material risks and tradeoffs explained to Karim in terms he can evaluate without needing engineering depth himself.

**The operating principle, stated exactly because precision here matters:** *plausible code is not evidence of correct code; plausible architecture is not evidence of correct architecture; a passing intuition is not evidence of correct behavior.* Where technical correctness can't be established from available evidence, the environment prefers `VERIFY` / `TEST` / `REVIEW` / `ESCALATE` over silent guessing — the same discipline as the general trustworthiness requirement above, applied specifically to implementation work. **Mechanism, again, is not pre-decided here — Opus determines the strongest project-appropriate combination after inspecting the actual development context**, though the candidate operating model's existing rows (`code-review`, the security plugins, advisor escalation) are **Strong candidate**, not proof of correctness on their own — per §B.7, they remain pending Opus/project validation, and testing/actual validation are the operative evidence, never the plugins' mere presence. **Exact final enforcement architecture: Opus-dependent.** |
| Cowork | Narrow, non-canonical document/scheduling tasks under the four established bounds | A genuinely recurring need in that narrow category | N/A beyond the specific task | Human review before anything derived from it is treated as decided | N/A | Shares the shared usage pool | Real but modest | **Strong candidate** — Opus should independently confirm it still earns a place once real recurring instances (or their absence) are visible |
| Agent Teams, MCP connectors, community-marketplace plugins, Find Skill tools, Fable | None currently | None met | — | — | — | — | — | **Not currently justified** |
| Opus's own reasoning discipline — planning, decomposition, evidence-first investigation, root-cause analysis, iterative verification, adversarial self-challenge, recovery from failed approaches, explicit uncertainty handling, long-horizon tracking | Applied proportionately to task consequence, never uniformly | Task risk, not task type | Whatever the task requires | The same tiered discipline this document models | Self-contained — this is the top of the chain | Scales with stakes, not a flat tax on everything | Matches reasoning depth to actual risk instead of over- or under-investing | **Established:** the project requires/recommends these principles, applied proportionately. **Opus-dependent:** their exact operationalization, weighting, sequencing, context/application rules, and actual effectiveness once realized inside AeroBridge work — specifying these principles here is not proof Opus will successfully perform them. |

### Performance objective: quality first, efficiency second — and this applies to Opus's own realized performance, not only the environment around it

This requirement concerns two things together, not one: the operating environment surrounding Opus, and Opus's own realized reasoning and execution performance within that environment. The objective is not merely a cleaner workflow around Opus — it is to maximize Opus's actual useful performance for AeroBridge, evaluating and, where justified, adopting any capability, workflow pattern, reasoning discipline, tool, mode, or coordination mechanism that materially improves its results.

The table above already applies proportionate-to-risk reasoning throughout; stated as an explicit principle rather than left implicit: **more reasoning, more checking, more tools, and more context are not automatically better — but neither is minimizing them when doing so would materially reduce correctness, depth, usefulness, or project value.** The correct priority order is quality first, efficiency second: when additional reasoning, context, verification, tools, time, or cost materially improves correctness or usefulness, accept that cost rather than sacrificing quality to save it; when additional resource usage would not produce a meaningful improvement, avoid the unnecessary cost and complexity. The objective is neither minimum nor maximum resource usage — it is **maximum justified project quality, with resource efficiency applied only where it does not compromise that quality.** Verification depth should track the actual consequence of being wrong, not a fixed number of self-review passes applied uniformly regardless of stakes. This does not weaken the existing budget constraint, and does not imply unlimited resource usage is desirable — it means spending additional resources when they buy meaningful quality, and saving them when they do not.

**On the specific question of importing operating characteristics from other strong long-horizon/agentic systems, including Fable 5.1:** the characteristics worth evaluating — deeper task planning, stronger decomposition, persistent goal tracking, evidence-first investigation, deliberate tool use, root-cause analysis, proportionate iterative verification, adversarial self-challenge, recovery from failed approaches, disciplined escalation — are not unique to any one system. They are general, well-established properties of strong agentic reasoning, and the right question is whether *each one specifically* improves Opus's performance on AeroBridge's actual tasks — never whether Opus should imitate Fable, be assumed equivalent to it, or adopt a capability merely because another system has it. This document does not assume any of them are free: several carry a real risk of unnecessary context consumption, over-verification, latency, or added complexity if applied without the same risk-proportionality already stated above. **Classification: the general principle (evaluate these characteristics on their individual, evidence-supported merit) is Established now; which specific ones to adopt, to what degree, and how they're weighted or sequenced is Opus-dependent** — this document doesn't pre-select them, consistent with not pre-selecting Skills or Plugins elsewhere. The governing question throughout is "what would most improve Opus's performance on AeroBridge," never "how do we make Opus behave like another model."

### Trustworthiness requirement — generalized beyond Amadeus

**Established as a core project requirement, mechanism deliberately left open:** the environment should structurally guard against, and prevent where practicable, guesses, generic model knowledge, plausible assumptions, unverified external claims, inferred system behavior, behavior borrowed from another product, or incomplete evidence being treated as authoritative — for any high-risk factual, technical, operational, product, engineering, or behavioral claim, not only Amadeus. No AI environment can guarantee perfect prevention of this under all circumstances; the requirement is to make unsupported claims non-authoritative and structurally disfavored, not to claim an impossible absolute guarantee. For Amadeus specifically, this already means never inventing command syntax, semantics, workflow order, preconditions, state transitions, responses, errors, recovery, or persistence behavior (file 05's own existing discipline, unchanged). Where evidence is insufficient, the environment should produce an explicit `UNKNOWN` / `VERIFY` / `ESCALATE` state rather than a plausible-sounding answer.

**This document does not decide the enforcement mechanism.** Whether this is best served by a Skill, a canonical rule, an operating rule, a Hook, a verification workflow, an evidence-tagging mechanism, or some combination is explicitly **Opus-dependent** — this is a requirement about the resulting environment's trustworthiness, not a prejudged answer about which tool enforces it.

### Designing for Karim's technical skill level — a requirement, not a simplification

Karim is not a technically experienced software engineer. **This raises the required standard, it does not lower it.** The environment must compensate structurally for a gap Karim cannot close himself: important code reviewed and tested rather than trusted because it looks plausible; architectural assumptions challenged and verified rather than accepted; security-sensitive or irreversible changes receiving stronger scrutiny; uncertain technical conclusions labeled as uncertain rather than presented as settled; difficult decisions escalated to stronger reasoning; validation and testing used as actual evidence of correctness, never model confidence; and material risks and tradeoffs explained to Karim in terms he can evaluate without needing engineering depth himself.

**The operating principle, stated exactly because precision here matters:** *plausible code is not evidence of correct code; plausible architecture is not evidence of correct architecture; a passing intuition is not evidence of correct behavior.* Where technical correctness can't be established from available evidence, the environment prefers `VERIFY` / `TEST` / `REVIEW` / `ESCALATE` over silent guessing — the same discipline as the general trustworthiness requirement above, applied specifically to implementation work. **Mechanism, again, is not pre-decided here — Opus determines the strongest project-appropriate combination after inspecting the actual development context**, though the candidate operating model's existing rows (`code-review`, the security plugins, advisor escalation) already partially embody this and are a reasonable starting point, not a final answer.

### Skills and other mechanisms must be validated after creation, not only at the decision to build them

Extending the existing "don't build until triggered" discipline with its necessary complement: once Opus (or a later phase) actually decides a Skill should exist, creation is not the finish line. It should be tested against representative real AeroBridge tasks, checked for output quality, checked for context/token cost, checked for unintended behavior or duplicated governance, compared against the plain non-Skill workflow it's meant to improve on, and retained, revised, or removed based on what's actually observed — the same logic applies to Plugins and any other new mechanism. **Availability is not evidence of usefulness; creation is not evidence of success; confidence is not evidence of correctness.** This is a lifecycle requirement for whatever Opus eventually builds, not something this pass performs on anything, since this pass builds nothing.

## Additional Adversarial Sweep

Per this task's own requirement to look past the twelve already-adjudicated observations for what an expert Opus reviewer would likely notice that nothing so far has: four genuine findings, checked honestly rather than manufactured to fill the section.

**This review chain has itself grown into exactly the kind of volume it warns against elsewhere.** This multi-pass review chain now runs to tens of thousands of words, produced while repeatedly insisting that `CLAUDE.md` stay short and canonical knowledge stay non-duplicated. This is worth naming plainly rather than left for Opus to notice unflagged: the honest resolution isn't to compress the existing chain retroactively, but to treat this document as the actual terminal consolidation — if a further pass were requested beyond this one, that itself would be evidence the process needs a different shape, not more iterations of the same one.

**A real internal tension between two of this chain's own recommendations, only now noticed:** Cowork's recommended permission mode ("ask before anything significant") and its recommended use case ("scheduled, unattended tasks") pull against each other — an unattended task can't be approved by anyone while it's running unattended. The resolution: the narrow scope already specified (external, read-only checks only — §Observation 10, prior pass) happens to already dissolve this tension, since reading a public page isn't a "significant" action requiring approval in the first place. Anything that *would* need approval should not be scheduled unattended at all. This connection was implicit before; it's explicit now.

**No canonicalization/lifecycle note exists for this operating-environment chain itself**, unlike the Learning Design Specification and Learning Experience Architecture, which both close with an explicit statement of their own path to canonical status. This document's own closing status line ("PROPOSED / NOT CANONICAL") states a current status, but a status declaration is not itself a canonicalization procedure — it does not define approval, promotion, or future governance transitions. This chain does not currently contain an explicit canonicalization/lifecycle procedure of its own, and this pass does not invent one; the omission is worth naming rather than implying the status line already resolves it.

**Repository-platform assumptions:** references to "GitHub" (the integration plugin, PR workflows) throughout this chain are examples, not a decision — no hosting platform has actually been chosen, and equivalent plugins exist for GitLab/Bitbucket/Azure DevOps in the same official marketplace. This should not be read as an implicit platform commitment.

No additional material weakness was identified within the explicitly bounded scope of this sweep, beyond those captured above and in the prior twelve-observation adjudication.

---

## C. What ChatGPT Got Right

Reconfirmed through the evidence base already reviewed in the prior passes, at the resolution stated in the Final Convergence Report's own adjudication and refined further in §B above: the Skills-portability correction (a genuine factual error, not an overstatement), the `opusplan` overclaim, the Fable REJECT, the hook-coverage gap, and the file-count finding — all reconfirmed here, none weakened.

## D. Where Claude Disagreed

**With the Convergence Report's own earlier position on the prompt-engineering mechanism and the canonical mirror** — this pass found both had been stated with more finality than the evidence supports, and corrected them into the tiered established/candidate/Opus-dependent structure above (§B.2, §B.3). This is a disagreement with this document's own immediate predecessor, stated plainly rather than smoothed over, per this task's own instruction not to preserve a prior pass's wording merely because it survived.

**With the Convergence Report's own earlier Opus-staging proposal** — superseded in §B.1 for the four-stage sequence, with the reasoning for the change shown rather than the swap made silently.

**No material ChatGPT observation remains unresolved after this pass** — every one of its twelve observations resulted in either a confirmed correction or a clean "checked, no fire found," never a rejection.

## E. What Remains Deliberately Open for Opus

Consolidated without duplicating the table above: every mechanism-choice item already tagged **Opus-dependent** in the Candidate Operating Model (canonical-mirror structure, hook configuration, the trustworthiness-requirement's enforcement mechanism, the Karim-protection enforcement architecture, Cowork's ultimate place, Claude Design's exact role, the delegation architecture beyond the established principle, and the weighting/operationalization of Opus's own reasoning-discipline principles) is not re-listed here. What's genuinely additional — Opus-dependent items that don't appear as their own table row — is: which language-server plugin fits the real stack, the exact scope/trigger/mechanism for the Prompt Engineering and Prompt Optimization capability described in §B.2, and whether "cloud sessions" share Cowork's account-skill sync or only load repo-committed skills.

Whether AeroBridge needs a selective historical-session continuity and retrieval mechanism beyond the current Project Knowledge, handoff/state/decision records, and canonical corpus; if so, what minimum architecture is justified (for example structured session records, selective indexing, on-demand retrieval, a retrieval subagent, or another mechanism), how historical information should remain subordinate to canonical truth, and what evidence would justify the added complexity and resource cost.


## F. Final Pre-Opus Architecture

**At the time of this preparation pass:** the current chat-based Project workflow, with the small open items already named (Custom Instructions confirmation, the optional memory-authority and file-count clarifications Karim may choose to act on).

**The candidate operating model above** is the strongest currently-justified starting point for how Opus, Sonnet, Claude Code, Claude Design, and Cowork should coordinate — explicitly a starting point, not a final architecture, per every classification column in that table.

**What's currently settled at the platform/tool level, independently of AeroBridge's repository findings:** the tool-level facts (Skills sync mechanics, the hook-coverage gap, Fable's billing structure, Pro-plan inclusions) — these don't change based on AeroBridge's specific corpus, only on Anthropic's own platform, which can itself change over time. They should be treated as currently established at the platform/tool level rather than re-litigated by Opus from scratch, while remaining subject to re-verification if the underlying platform changes.

**What's explicitly reserved for Opus**: every specific mechanism choice — which Skills, what exact repository structure, what exact enforcement mechanism for the trustworthiness and Karim-protection requirements, and whether/how a historical-session continuity and retrieval mechanism should exist — per the four-stage sequence in §B.1.

## G. Final Decision Register

Using KEEP / MODIFY / ADD / DEFER / REJECT / VERIFY / **OPUS-DEPENDENT**. Items from the five prior passes remain **KEEP** only where they have been re-tested, remain supported, or were otherwise positively confirmed across this preparation chain (see §A, §C, and §B's item-by-item treatment) — silence or mere absence from the table below is not itself approval.

| # | Item | Label | Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Opus staging sequence | **MODIFY** (four-stage, superseding this pass's own earlier draft) | §B.1 |
| 2 | Prompt Engineering / Prompt Optimization capability: scope, trigger, and mechanism | **OPUS-DEPENDENT** | §B.2 |
| 3 | Canonical-mirror exact structure | **OPUS-DEPENDENT** (necessity stays established) | §B.3 |
| 4 | `opusplan` context-limit characterization | **VERIFY**, framed as version-dependent, not permanent | §B.4 |
| 5 | Fable | **REJECT**, confirmed firm | §B.5 |
| 6 | Hook exact configuration | **OPUS-DEPENDENT** (the general vulnerability stays established) | §B.6 |
| 7 | General trustworthiness-requirement enforcement mechanism | **OPUS-DEPENDENT** (the requirement itself is **ADD**, established now) | New |
| 8 | Karim-technical-protection enforcement mechanism | **OPUS-DEPENDENT** (the requirement itself is **ADD**, established now) | New |
| 9 | Candidate Opus operating model | **ADD** — explicitly a starting point for Opus to adopt, modify, or reject | New |
| 10 | Skill/Plugin post-creation validation lifecycle | **ADD** | New |
| 11 | Cowork's ultimate place in the architecture | **OPUS-DEPENDENT** (narrow-use verdict stands as current best evidence) | New |
| 12 | Historical-session continuity and retrieval architecture | OPUS-DEPENDENT | §B.10 |
| 13 | Product and Learning Experience Quality Before Visual Expression | **ADD** — operating principle; not canonical product/learning truth | §B.12 |

## H. Readiness Verdict

> **READY FOR CLEAN OPUS REVIEW.**

Nothing materially useful remains that this pass can responsibly establish before Opus inspects the actual AeroBridge project corpus. This is a handoff-readiness claim, not a claim of exhaustive perfection: it means the available evidence has been consolidated, the preparation work is complete enough to hand off, and remaining questions have been explicitly left open wherever project-corpus inspection or Opus's own judgment is genuinely required — named throughout using the three-tier discipline rather than collapsed into false certainty. It does not mean it is impossible for any further issue to exist; it means further conclusions cannot responsibly be settled from this pass's own evidence before the actual corpus/repository is inspected.

**This document, together with the five passes before it, is the complete preparation package produced by this review chain** — not the entire material Opus will ever need, since Opus must still inspect the actual AeroBridge corpus/repository as part of its own mission. Per §B.1's own sequence: Opus should read this as Stage 1, calibrate its own operating method in Stage 2, inspect the relevant current AeroBridge corpus in Stage 3, and only then reconcile against these specific recommendations in Stage 4 — never inheriting them as established truth about AeroBridge's actual content, only as a considered, evidence-tested, and explicitly non-final starting point for its own independent design. If Opus's own assessment identifies a stronger sequencing for preserving independence or quality, §B.1 already states it should use that instead. Nothing in this Sixth Pass document is canonical; canonical authority remains with the approved AeroBridge corpus. Nothing has been implemented. Final authority remains Karim's.
